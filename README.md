**Dragon Ball API**
-

**What is this project about?**
-
In this project our objective is to make a Dragon Ball API, using just html, css and JavaScript. 

The page must also be responsive, so it can be seen through phones and tablets.


**How did i made it**
-
For this project I used: Html, Css, and JavaSript.

For the styles and cards I just used css and bootstrap.

I also made three html's and three css's, so I could style each one of the pages and cards, I also made two JavaScript for each one of the content (characters and planets).


**About the code**
-
In the css's I made most part of the classes with flex so it could be responsive.

In JavaScript I created my own classes and removed the bootstrap so I could edit the cards.

In html I have links to guide through the content and images to make it more good looking.
